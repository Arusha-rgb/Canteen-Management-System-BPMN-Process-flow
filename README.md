# Canteen-Management-System-Process-flow
A professional BPMN 2.0 process model designed in Camunda. This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a modern canteen—from customer ordering to automated kitchen preparation and order delivery.
# The Workflow
​The process is divided into three specialized lanes to ensure operational efficiency:
​Customer: Browses the menu, places orders, and completes digital payments.
​Order Preparing (Kitchen): Receives real-time order tickets and handles food preparation.
​Order Delivery: Manages the automated display board updates and the final hand-off to the customer.
